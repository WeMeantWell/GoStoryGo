    <h1>About Go Story Go</h1>
    <p>One day, a Daddy of a four year old boy noticed that his little boy was very curious. "He likes to learn!" The Daddy thought. Every time the Daddy was reading a story to his little boy, the little boy wanted to see what the pages looked like. "What's that?" He would ask his Daddy. Then he would point at the words and say, "What does that word say?"</p>

    <p>The Daddy thought, "Well, he wants to read, but he doesn't know how. I love to write, I would love it if my little boy loved to write too! It would be wonderful if we could write a children's book together!"</p>

    <p>So, the Daddy got on ChatGPT and started looking for a children's book writing software that he and his little boy could use together. But, what he was finding was nothing that was easy to use, or each software was missing something that would make it fun for the children, but also be fun for the parents to use as well.</p>

    <p>So, the Daddy asked ChatGPT, "Can you help me build our own version?" ChatGPT said, "Of course!"</p>

    <p>So the story begins. The Daddy started playing around with different ideas, and kept asking his little boy if he liked this idea or that. "Should it be that color or this?"</p>

    <p>They got to work together.</p>

    <p>First they created the software's mascot 'Inkling'. They refined him and refined him until he was perfect and adorable.</p>

    <p>Then they toyed with the software, introducing their ideas to ChatGPT and asking it to "change this" or "fix that" until they had a perfect, working, fun-to-use software that you have stumbled upon!</p>

    <p>Now, you can take all of their hard work and put together your own children's books! From start to finish, page-by-page, you can write, illustrate and even prepare for publication, from scratch, a book about butterflies that build a spaceship, or bumble bees who build houses out of honey but always seem to get themselves into sticky situations. Whatever you want!</p>

    <p>You can upload your own pictures as your backgrounds and illustrations, or you can use the AI programmed into the software to help you with it! Whatever you want, just have fun with it!</p>

    <p>Our mission is to make it easy and fun to create children's books. For adults or children, this software is for you! And we have priced it so anyone can afford it!</p>

    <p>Keep checking with us. Next in line we will be making a Tablet-friendly App, Phone App, and a Children's Version that doesn't require reading! Please come back and check in with us regularly!</p>
