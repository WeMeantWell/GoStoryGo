  <div class="story">
    <p>One day, a Daddy of a four-year-old boy noticed that his little boy was very curious. <strong>"He likes to learn!"</strong> the Daddy thought. Every time the Daddy was reading a story to his little boy, the little boy wanted to see what the pages looked like. <strong>"What's that?"</strong> he would ask. Then he would point at the words and say, <strong>"What does that word say?"</strong></p>

    <p>The Daddy thought, <strong>"Well, he wants to read, but he doesn't know how. I love to write, I would love it if my little boy loved to write too! It would be wonderful if we could write a children's book together!"</strong></p>

    <p>So, the Daddy got on ChatGPT and started looking for a children's book writing software that he and his little boy could use together. But everything he found was either too hard to use, or missing something that made it fun for children and parents alike.</p>

    <p>So the Daddy asked ChatGPT, <strong>"Can you help me build our own version?"</strong> ChatGPT said, <strong>"Of course!"</strong></p>

    <p>So the story begins. The Daddy started playing around with ideas, asking his little boy which ones he liked. <strong>"Should it be that color or this?"</strong></p>

    <p>They got to work — together.</p>

    <p>First they created the software's mascot, <strong>Inkling</strong>. They refined him again and again until he was perfect and adorable.</p>

    <p>Then they tinkered with the software itself, feeding ideas to ChatGPT and asking it to <strong>"change this"</strong> or <strong>"fix that"</strong> — until at last, they had a working, fun-to-use software. The very one you've just discovered!</p>

    <p>Now you can take all their hard work and use it to build your own children's books! From start to finish, page-by-page, you can write, illustrate, and even prepare your book for publication — about butterflies that build spaceships, or bumble bees who make houses out of honey but always get into sticky situations. Whatever your imagination dreams up!</p>

    <p>You can upload your own illustrations, or use the built-in AI to help you along the way. Whatever you want — just <strong>have fun with it!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Our mission is to make it easy and fun to create children's books.</strong> Whether you're an adult or a child, this software is for you — and we've priced it so anyone can afford it!</p>

    <p class="whats-next">What’s next?</p>
    <p>A tablet-friendly app. A phone version. A special version for kids that doesn't require reading at all! Keep checking in — there's more coming soon.</p>
